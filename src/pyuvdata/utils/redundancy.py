    Find redundant groups using a gridding algorithm developed by the HERA team.

    This is essentially a gridding approach, but it only keeps track of the grid
    points that have baselines assigned to them. It iterates through the
    baselines and assigns each baseline to a an existing group if it is within
    a grid spacing or makes a new group if there is no group. The location of
    the group is the baseline vector of the first baseline assigned to it, rounded
    to the grid spacing, so the resulting assigned grid point can depend on the
    order in which baseline vectors are passed to it. It is possible for a baseline
    to be assigned to a group that is up to but strictly less than 4 times the
    grid spacing from its true location, so we use a grid a factor of 4 smaller
    than the passed tolerance (`tol`). This method is quite robust for regular
    arrays if the tolerance is properly specified, but may not behave predictably
    for highly non-redundant arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    baselines : array_like of int
        Baseline numbers, shape (Nbls,)
    baseline_vecs : array_like of float
        Baseline vectors in meters, shape (Nbls, 3).
