    General class for reading Mir datasets.

    Does lots of cool things! There are static functions that allow you low level
    access to mir files without needing to create an object.  You can also
    instantiate a MirParser object with the constructor of this class which will only
    read the metadata into memory by default. Read in the raw data through the
    use of the load_cross and load_auto flags, or by using the load_data() function
    once the object is created. This allows for the flexible case of quickly loading
    metadata first to check whether or not to load additional data into memory.

        ----------
        vis_dict : dict
            A dictionary in the format of `vis_data`, where the keys are matched to
            individual values of sphid in `sp_data`, and each entry contains a dict
            with two items: "data", an array of np.complex64 containing the
            visibilities, and "flags", an array of bool containing the per-channel
            flags of the spectrum (both are of length equal to `sp_data["nch"]` for the
            corresponding value of sphid).

        Returns
        -------
        raw_dict : dict
            A dictionary in the format of `raw_data`, where the keys are matched to
            individual values of sphid in `sp_data`, and each entry contains a dict
            with two items: "scale_fac", and np.int16 which describes the common
            exponent for the spectrum, and "data", an array of np.int16 (of length
            equal to twice that found in `sp_data["nch"]` for the corresponding value
            of sphid) containing the compressed visibilities.  Note that entries equal
            to -32768 aren't possible with the compression scheme used for MIR, and so
            this value is used to mark flags.

        data_type : str
            Type of data to read, must either be "cross" (cross-correlations) or "auto"

        return_vis : bool
            If set to True, will return a dictionary containing the visibilities read

            the visibilities read in the "raw" format. Default is True.
        use_mmap : bool
            If False, then each integration record needs to be read in before it can
            be parsed on a per-spectral record basis (which can be slow if only reading
            a small subset of the data). Default is True, which will leverage mmap to
            access data on disk (that does not require reading in the whole record).
            There is usually no performance penalty to doing this, although reading in
            data is slow, you may try seeing this to False and seeing if performance
            improves.
        read_only : bool
            Only applicable if `return_vis=False` and `use_mmap=True`. If set to True,

        Load visibility data into MirParser class.

        Method for loading the visibility data into the object. Can either load the
        compressed "raw data" (which is about half the size in memory, but carries
        overheads in various function calls _except_ for writing to disk) or the
        uncompressed "vis data" (floating point values).

        Note that this function will only load either  vis data or raw data, not
        both. If told to load both, then the method will default to loading only the
        vis data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        load_auto: bool
            Load the autos (floats) into object. Default is True if the object has
            auto-correlation data, otherwise False.
        load_cross : bool
            Load the cross-correlation visibility data (floats) into object. Default is
            True if if the object has cross-correlation data, otherwise False.
        load_raw : bool
            Nominally when loading cross-correlation data, the data are uncompressed
            when being loaded into the object, and put into the attribute `vis_data`.
            However, if set to True, the "raw" (compressed) data are put into the
            attribute `raw_data`. Default is False.
        apply_tsys : bool
            Apply tsys corrections to the data. Only applicable if loading
            cross-correlation vis data (where `load_raw=False`). Default is True.
        allow_downselect : bool
            If data has been previously loaded, and all spectral records are currently
            contained in `vis_data`, `raw_data`, and/or `auto_data`, then down-select
            from the currently loaded data rather than reading the data from disk.
            Default is True if all spectral records have been previously loaded,
            otherwise False.
        allow_conversion : bool
            Allow the method to convert previously loaded uncompressed ("raw") data into
            "normal" data. Only applicable if loading cross-correlation data (and
            `load_raw=False`). Default is True if all of the required spectral records
            have been loaded into the `raw_data` attribute.
        use_mmap : bool
            If False, then each integration record needs to be read in before it can
            be parsed on a per-spectral record basis (which can be slow if only reading
            a small subset of the data). Default is True, which will leverage mmap to
            access data on disk (that does not require reading in the whole record).
            There is usually no performance penalty to doing this, although reading in
            data is slow, you may try seeing this to False and seeing if performance
            improves.
        read_only : bool
            Only applicable if `load_cross=True`, `use_mmap=True`, and `load_raw=True`.
            If set to True, will return back data arrays which are read-only. Default is
            False.

            will contain the spectrally averaged data.
        return_vis : bool
            If True, return data in the "normal" visibility format, where each
            spectral record has a key of "sphid" and a value being a dict of

        Add two MirParser objects.

        This method allows for combining MirParser objects under two different
        scenarios. In the first, which we call a "merge", two objects are instantiated
        from the same file, but may have different data loaded due to, for example,
        different calls to `select` being run. In the second scenario, which we call
        a "concatenation", objects are instantiated from different files, which need
        to be recombined (e.g., a single track is broken in half due to an
        intervening observation/system hiccup/etc.).

        Note that while some checking is performed to check if the metadata objects
        look identical, no checking is done on the `vis_data`, `raw_data`, and
        `auto_data` attributes (other than that they exist). If either object does not
        have data loaded, then the resultant object will also have no data loaded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : MirParser object
            Other MirParser object to combine with this data set.
        overwrite : bool
            If set to True, metadata from `other` will overwrite that present in
            this object, even if they differ. Default is False.
        merge : bool
            If set to True, assume that the objects originate from the amd file, and
            combine them together accordingly. If set to False, assume the two objects
            originate from _different_ files, and concatenate them together. By default,
            the method will check the internal file dictionary to see if it appears the
            two objects come from the same file(s), automatically choosing between
            merging or concatenating.
        force : bool
            If set to True, bypass certain checks to force the method to combine the
            two objects. Note that this option should be used with care, as it can
            result in objects with duplicate data (which may affect downstream
            processing), or loss of support for handling auto-correlations within
            the object. Default is False.
        inplace : bool
            If set to True, replace this object with the one resulting from the
            addition operation. Default is False.

        Returns
        -------
        new_obj : MirParser object
            A new object that contains the combined data of the two objects. Only

        ------
        TypeError
            If attempting to add a MirParser object with any other type of object.
        ValueError
            If the objects cannot be combined, either because of differing metadata (if
            `overwrite=False`), or because the two objects appear to be loaded from
            the same files but have different internal mappings (usually caused by the
            MirParser object being added to another object, prior to the addition).
            Also raised if metadata differ between objects and overwrite=False.
        UserWarning

            were found between the two datasets when concatenating data.

        Add two MirMetaData objects in place.

        Combine two MirMetaData objects together, nominally under the assumption that
        they have been read in by the same file. If two objects are read in from
        _different_ files, then users may find the `concat` method more appropriate
        to use.

        Note that while some metadata checking is performed to verify that the objects
        look identical, no checking is done on the `vis_data`, `raw_data`, and
        `auto_data` attributes (other than that they exist).

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : MirParser object
            Other MirParser object to combine with this data set.
        merge : bool
            If set to True, assume that the objects originate from the amd file, and
            combine them together accordingly. If set to False, assume the two objects
            originate from _different_ files, and concatenate them together. By default,
            the method will check the internal file dictionary to see if it appears the
            two objects come from the same file(s), automatically choosing between
            merging or concatenating.
        overwrite : bool
            If set to True, metadata from `other` will overwrite that present in
            this object, even if they differ. Default is False.
        force : bool
            If set to True, bypass certain checks to force the method to combine the
            two objects. Note that this option should be used with care, as it can
            result in objects with duplicate data (which may affect downstream
            processing), or loss of support for handling auto-correlations within
            the object. Default is False.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If attempting to add a MirParser object with any other type of object.
        ValueError
            If the objects cannot be combined, either because of differing metadata (if
            `overwrite=False`), different data being loaded (raw vs vis vs auto), or
            because the two objects appear to be loaded from different files (and
            `force=False`).

        Select a subset of data inside a Mir-formatted file.

        This routine allows for one to select a subset of data within a Mir dataset,
        based on various metadata. The select command is designed to be flexible,
        allowing for both multiple simultaneous selections and serial calls. Users
        should be aware that the command is case sensitive, and uses "strict" agreement
        (i.e., it does not mimic the behavior is `np.isclose`) with metadata values.
        By default, multiple selection criteria are combined together via an "and"
        operation; for example, if you wanted to select only data from Antenna 1 while
        on 3c84, you would set `where=(("source", "eq", "3c84"), ("ant", "eq", 1))`.

        The select command will automatically translate information in `codes_data`, the
        and the various indexing keys, e.g., it will convert an allowed value for
        "source" (found in`codes_read`) into allowed values for "isource" (found in
        `in_read`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        where : tuple or list of tuples
            Optional argument, where tuple is used to identify a matching subset of
            data. Each tuple must be 3 elements in length, consisting of the "selection
            field", the "comparison operator", and the "comparison value". The selection
            field match one of the field names inside one of the metadata attributes
            (e.g., "ant1", "mjd", "source", "fsky"). The comparison operator specifies
            how the metadata are compared against the selection field. Allowed
            comparisons include:
            "eq" or "==" (equal to);
            "ne" or "!=" (not equal to);
            "lt" or "<" (less than);
            "le" or "<=" (less than or equal to);
            "gt" or ">" (greater than);
            "ge" or ">=" (greater than or equal to);
            "between" (between a range of values);
            "outside" (outside of a range of values).
            The selection value are the value or sequence of values to compare against
            that present in the selection field. Note that in most cases, this should be
            a single number, unless the comparison operator is "between" our "outside"
            (which requires a this element to be a sequence of length 2), of "eq" or
            "ne", where either a single value (string or number), or multiple values can
            be supplied in a single where statement. Multiple selections can be made by
            supplying a sequence of 3-element tuples, where the results of each
            selection are combined based on the value of `and_where_args`.
        and_where_args : bool
            If set to True, then the individual calls to the `where` method will be
            combined via an element-wise "and" operator, such that the returned array
            will report the positions where all criteria are met. If False, results
            are instead combined via an element-wise "or" operator. Default is True.
            If supplied, the argument for `mask` will be combined with the output from
            the calls to `where` with the same logic.
        and_mask : bool
            If set to True, then the mask generated by the selection criteria above will
            be combined with the existing mask values using an element-wise "and"
            operation. If set to False, the two will instead be combined with an
            element-wise "or" operation. Default is True.
        update_data : bool
            Whether or not to update the visibility values (as recorded in the
            attributes `vis_data` and `raw_data`). If set to True, it will force data
            to be loaded from disk, based on what had been previously loaded. If False,
            it will unload those attributes. The default is to do nothing if data are
            not loaded, otherwise to downselect from the existing data in the object
            if all records are present (and otherwise unload the data).
        reset : bool
            If set to True, undoes any previous filters, so that all records are once
            again visible.Default is False.

        Calculate the kernel for shifting a spectrum a given number of channels.

        This function will calculate the parameters required for shifting a given

            Interpolation for Digital Image Processing" by Robert Keys for more details

        tol : float
            If the desired frequency shift is close enough to an integer number of
            channels, then the method will forgo any attempt and interpolation and
            will simply return the nearest channel desired. The tolerance for choosing
            this behavior is given by this parameter, in units of number of channels.
            The default is 1e-3, which means that if the desired shift is within one
            one-thousandth of an existing channel, the method will (for the frequency
            window in question) the nearest-neighbor interpolation scheme. Must be
            in the range [0, 0.5].

            kernel, which depends on `kernel_type` (0 for "nearest", 2 for "linear" and

        ----------
        freq_shift : ndarray
            Amount to shift each spectral window by in frequency space. Shape is the

            argument is provided (or if set to None), then the method will assume you

            Interpolation for Digital Image Processing" by Robert Keys for more details

            provides the best spectral PSF.

            If the desired frequency shift is close enough to an integer number of
            channels, then the method will forgo any attempt and interpolation and
            will simply return the nearest channel desired. The tolerance for choosing
            this behavior is given by this parameter, in units of number of channels.
            The default is 1e-3, which means that if the desired shift is within one
            one-thousandth of an existing channel, the method will (for the frequency
            window in question) the nearest-neighbor interpolation scheme.
        flag_adj : bool
            Option to flag channels adjacent to those that are flagged, the number of
            which depends on the interpolation scheme (1 additional channel with linear
            interpolation, and 3 additional channels with cubic convolution). Set to
            True by default, which prevents the window from having an inconsistent
            spectral PSF across the band.
        fix_freq : bool
            Only used if `freq_shift` is left unset (or otherwise set to None). Some
            versions of MIR data have frequency information incorrectly stored. If set
            to True, this metadata will be fixed before doppler-shifting the data. By
            default, the method will apply this correction if the version of the MIR
            data format is known to have the defective metadata.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If tol is outside of the range [0, 0.5], or if kernel_type does not match
            the list of supported values. Also if providing no argument to freq_shift,
            but doppler-tracking information cannot be determined (either because
            it's the wrong file version or because the receiver code isn't recognized).
