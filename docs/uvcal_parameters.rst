UVCal Parameters
==============
These are the standard attributes of UVCal objects.

Under the hood they are actually properties based on UVParameter objects.

Required
----------------
These parameters are required to have a sensible UVCal object and 
are required for most kinds of uv cal files.

**Nants_data**
     Number of antennas with data present (i.e. number of unique entries in ant_1_array and ant_2_array). May be smaller than the number of antennas in the array

**Nants_telescope**
     Number of antennas in the array. May be larger than the number of antennas with data

**Nfreqs**
     Number of frequency channels

**Njones**
     Number of polarizations calibrationparameters (Number of jones matrix elements.).

**Nspws**
     Number of spectral windows (ie non-contiguous spectral chunks). More than one spectral window is not currently supported.

**Ntimes**
     Number of times

**antenna_names**
     List of antenna names, shape (Nants_telescope), with numbers given by antenna_numbers (which can be matched to ant_1_array and ant_2_array). There must be one entry here for each unique entry in ant_1_array and ant_2_array, but there may be extras as well.

**antenna_numbers**
     List of integer antenna numbers corresponding to antenna_names,shape (Nants_telescope). There must be one entry here for each unique entry in ant_1_array and ant_2_array, but there may be extras as well.

**cal_type**
     cal type parameter. Values are delay, gain or unknown.

**channel_width**
     Channel width of of a frequency bin. Units Hz.

**flag_array**
     Array of flags to be applied to calibrated data (logical OR                  of input and flag generated by calibration). True is flagged.shape: (Nants_data, Nfreqs, Ntimes, Njones), type = bool.

**freq_array**
     Array of frequencies, shape (Nspws, Nfreqs), units Hz

**freq_range**
     ('Frequency range that gain solutions are valid for.', 'list: (start_frequency, end_frequency) in Hz.')

**gain_convention**
     The convention for applying he calibration solutions to data.Indicates that to calibrate one should divide or multiply uncalibrated data by gains.

**history**
     String of history, units English

**integration_time**
     Integration time of a time bin (s).

**jones_array**
     Array of antenna polarization integers, shape (Njones). linear pols -5:-8 (jxx, jyy, jxy, jyx).circular pols -1:-4 (jrr, jll. jrl, jlr).

**quality_array**
     Array of qualities of calibration solutions                 shape: (Nants_data, Nfreqs, Ntimes, Njones), type = float.

**telescope_name**
     Name of telescope. e.g. HERA. String.

**time_array**
     Array of times, center of integration, shape (Ntimes), units Julian Date

**time_range**
     ('Time range (in JD) that gain solutions are valid for.', 'list: (start_time, end_time) in JD.')

**x_orientation**
     Orientation of the physical dipole corresponding to what is labelled as the x polarization. Values are east (east/west orientation),  north (north/south orientation) or unknown.

Optional
----------------
These parameters are defined by one or more file standard but are not always required.
Some of them are required depending on the cal_type (as noted below).

**delay_array**
     Array of delays. shape: (Nants_data, Ntimes, Njones), type = float

**gain_array**
     Array of gains, shape: (Nants_data, Nfreqs, Ntimes, Njones), type = complex float.

**git_hash_cal**
     Commit hash of calibration software(from git_origin_cal) usedto generate solutions.

**git_origin_cal**
     Origin (on github for e.g) of calibration software. Url and branch.

**input_flag_array**
     Array of input flags, True is flagged. shape: (Nants_data, Nfreqs, Ntimes, Njones), type = bool.

**observer**
     Name of observer who calculated solutions in this file.
