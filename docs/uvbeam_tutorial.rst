UVBeam
------

UVBeam objects hold all of the metadata and data required to work with primary beam
models for radio telescopes. UVBeam supports both E-field and power beams
(labeled by the ``beam_type`` attribute) in a few different coordinate and gridding
systems (e.g. regular azimuth/zenith angle grids, zenith-based HEALPix grids, labeled
by the ``pixel_coordinate_system`` attribute).

For E-field beams, UVBeam supports specifying the E-field components in two or three
directions which may not align with the pixel coordinate system (or even be orthogonal).
The mapping between the E-field component vectors and unit vectors aligned with the
pixel coordinate system is defined per pixel in the ``basis_vector_array``. That array
has an axis of length ``Naxes_vec`` which is the number of E-field components used to
specify the antenna response in each pixel, and an axis of length ``Ncomponents_vec``
which is the number of orthogonal unit vectors aligned with the pixel coordinate system
(in addition to the pixel coordinate system axis or axes). Some examples of these
parameters for common beam pixel and E-field coordinate systems include:

- pixels in regularly gridded azimuth and zenith angle, E-field in components aligned
  with azimuth and zenith angle in each pixel

  - ``Naxis_vec = 2``
  - ``Ncomponents_vec = 2``
  - ``basis_vector_array`` only contains ``1`` and ``0`` values, with ``1`` on the
    diagonal for each pixel.

    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 0, :, :] = 1``
    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 1, :, :] = 0``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 0, :, :] = 0``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 1, :, :] = 1``

- pixels in regularly gridded azimuth and zenith angle, Efield in (x,y,z) components.

  - ``Naxis_vec = 3``
  - ``Ncomponents_vec = 2``
  - ``basis_vector_array`` contains the mapping from (x, y, z) to (azimuth, zenith_angle)
    for the E-field (which is always orthogonal to the radial vector pointing to the
    pixel). The details of this mapping depend on the choice of how the (x, y, z) axes
    are labeled. UVBeam uses azimuth running from East to North. If +x points to East,
    +y points to North and +z points to the zenith:

    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 0, az, za] = -sin(az)``
    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 1, az, za] = cos(az)``
    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 2, az, za] = 0``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 0, az, za] = cos(za)cos(az)``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 1, az, za] = cos(za)sin(az)``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 2, az, za] = -sin(za)``

- pixels in an azimuth and zenith angle Healpix map (with zenith at the north pole) with
  E-field in components aligned with azimuth and zenith angle in each pixel.

  - ``Naxis_vec = 2``
  - ``Ncomponents_vec = 2``
  - ``basis_vector_array`` only contains ``1`` and ``0`` values, with ``1`` on the
    diagonal for each pixel.

    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 0, :] = 1``
    - ``basis_vector_array[0, 1, :] = 0``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 0, :] = 0``
    - ``basis_vector_array[1, 1, :] = 1``

UVBeam: parameter shape changes
-------------------------------
As detailed in :ref:`uvdata_future_shapes`, UVData objects now support flexible spectral
windows and will have several parameter shapes change in version 3.0. UVData objects
also have a method to convert to the planned future array shapes now to support an
orderly conversion of code and packages that use UVData objects to the future shapes.

UVBeam objects will also see parameter shape changes in version 3.0, but will not add
support for flexible spectral windows as there does not currently seem to be a need for
spectral window support currently in UVBeam.

In version 3.0, several parameters will change shape. The length 1 axis that was
originally intended for the spectral windows axis will be removed from the
``data_array`` , ``freq_array``, ``bandpass_array``, ``receiver_temperature_array``,
``loss_array``, ``mismatch_array``, ``s_parameters`` and ``coupling_matrix``.
In addition, the ``spw_array`` and ``Nspws`` parameters will become optional.

In order to support an orderly conversion of code and packages that use the UVBeam
object to these new parameter shapes, we have created the
:meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.use_future_array_shapes` method which will change the parameters
listed above to have their future shapes. We have also added ``use_future_array_shapes``
parameters to the :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read` and :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.from_file` methods
(as well as the underlying :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read_beamfits`,
:meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read_cst_beam`, :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read_mwa_beam` methods),
which can be set to ``True`` to yield an object with the future shapes. Users writing
new code that uses UVBeam objects are encouraged to call the ``use_future_array_shapes``
method immediately after creating a UVBeam object or use the corresponding parameter
when reading in data from a file to ensure that the code will be compatible with the
forthcoming changes. Developers and maintainers of existing code that uses UVBeam
objects are encouraged to similarly update their code to use the new shapes at their
earliest convenience to ensure future compatibility. The method and parameters will be
deprecated but not removed in version 3.0 (it will just become a no-op) so that code
that calls it will continue to function.

UVBeam: Reading/writing
-----------------------
Reading and writing beam files using UVBeam.

The text files saved out of CST beam simulations do not have much of the
critical metadata needed for UVBeam objects. When reading in CST files, you
can either provide the required metadata using keywords to the :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read` method
and pass the raw CST files, or you can pass a settings yaml file which lists
the raw files and provides the required metadata to the :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read` method. Both
options are shown in the examples below. More details on creating a new yaml
settings files can be found in :doc:`cst_settings_yaml`.

UVBeam (like UVData) has a generic :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.read` method and a
:meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.from_file` class method in addition to the file-type specific
methods.

  ...                  'NicCSTbeams/HERA_NicCST_123MHz.txt']]

  # You have to specify the telescope_name, feed_name, feed_version, model_name
  # and model_version because they are not included in the raw CST files.
  # You should also specify the polarization that the file represents and you can

**********************************
.. code-block:: python

  >>> import os
  >>> from pyuvdata import UVBeam
  >>> from pyuvdata.data import DATA_PATH
  >>> import numpy as np

  >>> # the same interface as for power beams, just specify beam_type = 'efield'
  >>> settings_file = os.path.join(DATA_PATH, 'NicCSTbeams/NicCSTbeams.yaml')
  >>> beam = UVBeam.from_file(settings_file, beam_type='efield', use_future_array_shapes=True)

  >>> beam3 = UVBeam.from_file(settings_file, beam_type="efield", use_future_array_shapes=True)
  >>> beam == beam3
  True

c) Reading in the MWA full embedded element beam
************************************************
.. code-block:: python

  >>> # To get all the frequencies available for the MWA full embedded element beam
  >>> # you need to download the output simulation file via

  >>> beam = UVBeam.from_file(
  ...    mwa_beam_file, pixels_per_deg=1, delays=delays, use_future_array_shapes=True
  ... )


d) Writing a regularly gridded beam FITS file
**********************************************
When reading a beam FITS file, you also have the option of selecting frequencies and
az/za values at the read step -- i.e. so that memory is never allocated for data outside
these ranges. Use the ``freq_range``, ``za_range`` and ``az_range`` parameters to
achieve this. The ``freq_range`` parameter will be effective for both HEALpix beamfits
files and az/za grid.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import os
  >>> from pyuvdata import UVBeam
  >>> from pyuvdata.data import DATA_PATH
  >>> settings_file = os.path.join(DATA_PATH, 'NicCSTbeams/NicCSTbeams.yaml')
  >>> beam = UVBeam()
  >>> beam.read(
  ...    settings_file,
  ...    beam_type='power',
  ...    freq_range=(1e8, 1.5e8),
  ...    za_range=(0, 90.0),
  ...    use_future_array_shapes=True,
  ... )
  >>> write_file = os.path.join('.', 'tutorial.fits')
  >>> beam.write_beamfits(write_file, clobber=True)

e) Writing a HEALPix beam FITS file
***********************************
See :ref:`uvbeam_to_healpix` for more details on the :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.to_healpix` method.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import os
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from pyuvdata import UVBeam
  >>> from pyuvdata.data import DATA_PATH
  >>> settings_file = os.path.join(DATA_PATH, 'NicCSTbeams/NicCSTbeams.yaml')
  >>> beam = UVBeam.from_file(settings_file, beam_type='power', use_future_array_shapes=True)

  >>> # note that the `to_healpix` method requires astropy_healpix to be installed
  >>> # this beam file is very large. Let's cut down the size to ease the computation
  >>> # More on the `select` method is covered in the following section
  >>> za_max = np.deg2rad(10.0)
  >>> za_inds_use = np.nonzero(beam.axis2_array <= za_max)[0]
  >>> beam.select(axis2_inds=za_inds_use)

  >>> beam.to_healpix()
  >>> write_file = os.path.join('.', 'tutorial.fits')
  >>> beam.write_beamfits(write_file, clobber=True)

UVBeam: Selecting data
----------------------
The :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.select` method lets you select specific image axis indices
(or pixels if pixel_coordinate_system is HEALPix), frequencies and feeds
(or polarizations if beam_type is power) to keep in the object while removing others.

a) Selecting a range of Zenith Angles
*************************************
.. code-block:: python

  >>> import os
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from pyuvdata import UVBeam
  >>> from pyuvdata.data import DATA_PATH
  >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # doctest: +SKIP

  >>> new_beam = beam.select(axis2_inds=np.arange(0, 20), inplace=False)

  >>> # plot zenith angle cut through beams
  >>> plt.plot(beam.axis2_array, beam.data_array[0, 0, 0, 0, :, 0], # doctest: +SKIP
  ...         new_beam.axis2_array, new_beam.data_array[0, 0, 0, 0, :, 0], 'r')
  >>> plt.xscale('log') # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> plt.xlabel('Zenith Angle (radians)') # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> plt.ylabel('Power') # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> plt.show() # doctest: +SKIP

a) Selecting Feeds or Polarizations
***********************************
Selecting feeds on E-field beams can be done using the feed name (e.g. "x" or "y"). If
``x_orientation`` is set on the object, strings represting the physical orientation of
the feed can also be used (e.g. "n" or "e).

Selecting polarizations on power beams can be done either using the polarization
numbers or the polarization strings (e.g. "xx" or "yy" for linear polarizations or
"rr" or "ll" for circular polarizations). If ``x_orientation`` is set on the object,
strings represting the physical orientation of the dipole can also be used (e.g. "nn"
or "ee).

  ['xx']


.. _uvbeam_to_healpix:

UVBeam: Interpolating to HEALPix
--------------------------------
Note that interpolating from one gridding format to another incurs interpolation
errors. If the beam is going to be interpolated (e.g. to source locations) in
downstream code we urge the user use the beam in the original format to avoid incurring
extra interpolation errors.

UVBeam: Calculating beam areas
------------------------------
Calculations of the beam area and beam squared area are frequently required inputs for
Epoch of Reionization power spectrum calculations. These areas can be calculated for
either instrumental or pseudo Stokes beams using the :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.get_beam_area`
and :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.get_beam_sq_area` methods. Currently these methods do require
that the beams are in Healpix coordinates in order to take advantage of equal pixel areas.
They can be interpolated to HEALPix using the :meth:`pyuvdata.UVBeam.to_healpix` method.
