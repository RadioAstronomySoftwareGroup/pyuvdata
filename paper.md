# Summary
pyuvdata is an open-source software package that seeks to provide a well-documented,
feature-rich interface for many of the different data formats that exist within radio
interferometry, including support for reading and writing the following formats:
UVH5 [@uvh5], UVFITS [@uvfits], MIRIAD [@miriad], and measurement set [@ms] visibility
files. It offers read-only support for FHD [@fhd] and MIR [@mir] visibility save files.
Additionally, pyuvdata supports reading/writing measurement set, CalFITS [@calfits], and
CalH5 [@calh5] calibration solutions; and reading of FHD calibration solutions. pyuvdata
also provides interfaces for and handling of models of antenna primary beams, including
BeamFITS [@beamfits] (read and write), CST (read-only), MWA beam formats (read-only).
It also provides interfaces for handling of data flags.

# Statement of Need
There are several standard formats for astronomical interferometric data, but
translating between them in a robust and well-understood way has historically been
challenging.  This is partially due to conflicting assumptions and standards, giving
rise to significant (though sometimes subtle) differences between formats.
Interfacing with different data formats -- like one does when they convert from one
format to another -- thus requires careful accounting for the complex mathematical
relationships between both data and metadata to ensure proper data fidelity. This is
required both for leveraging existing community-favored tools that are typically built
to interface with a specific data format, as well as analyses requiring bespoke tools
for specialized types of analyses and simulations leveraging data in a variety of
formats.

pyuvdata has been designed to facilitate interoperability between different instruments
and codes by providing high quality, well documented conversion routines as well as an
interface to interact with interferometric data and simulations directly in Python.
Originally motivated to support new low frequency instruments (e.g. MWA:
http://www.mwatelescope.org/, PAPER: http://eor.berkeley.edu/, HERA:
http://reionization.org/), the capabilities of pyuvdata have been steadily expanded
to support handling of data from several telescopes, ranging from meter to submillimeter
wavelengths (including SMA: https://cfa.harvard.edu/sma, ALMA, SMA, VLA, ATCA, CARMA,
LWA, among others).

# Major updates in this version
In the time since it was initially published [@pyuvdata_v1], pyuvdata has undergone a
significant expansion in capabilities. In addition to general performance improvements
and restructuring, the newest version of pyuvdata includes several new major features,
including:

- The addition of the `UVCal` class, which provides a container for handling calibration
solutions (bandpass, delays, and gains) for interferometric data. Supported data formats
include MS, FHD, CalFITS, and CalH5.
- The addition of the `UVBeam` class, which provides a container for handling models
of the primary beam for antennas within an interferometric array. Supported data formats
include BeamFITS, MWA, and CST.
- The addition of the `UVFlag` class, which provides a container for handling flags/masking
of bad data for visibility data.
- Drastically improved handling of astrometry.
- Increased speed and accuracy of algorithms used to ``phase-up'' data (i.e., change
the sky position where the interferometer is centered up on).
- Support for several new visibility data formats, including MIR, MS, and MWA/MWAX.
- Support for data sets containing multiple spectral windows.
- Support for data sets containing observations of multiple sources/phase centers.
- Many new convenience methods for working with interferometric data, including
splitting and combining data sets, averaging in time and frequency, and applying
calibration solutions and flags.
